Idle Experimentation with libjit
================================

In a nutshell, this can just JIT a very simple AST.
It comes with the definition of the AST, so it's easy to
create one for testing from C. The language only supports
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (all binary),
variables (int, double) and constants (also int, double).
Any compiled function uses either ints or doubles as in- and
output. If any type is a double, then all are upgraded to
doubles.

The Makefile is very rudimentary. Sorry.

As stated above, this uses libjit. To get started, this is basically
what you need to do (after getting a checkout of this repo):

Install libjit locally:

  $ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/dotgnu-pnet/libjit.git
  $ cd libgit
  $ autoreconf -i -f
  $ ./configure --prefix=$PWD/../libjit-install
  $ make install
  $ cd ..

Compile and run:

  (optionally run make regen)
  $ make
  $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libjit-install/lib ./jit_test
